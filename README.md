# Privacy Policy

## 1– User Data

No sensitive data is collected from the user to use this app, such as age, gender, address etc. The only data stored in the app will be data on dreams the user enters. This is securely stored on the user’s device in an encrypted database.

## 2- Device Data

No data about the user’s device will be tracked or stored by this app.

## 3- Sending/ Receiving data

The only time any data is in transit is when saving backups of the database. When doing so the user will set a password to secure the database before sending the database in an email to the user. 
As a password has been set, if this database were to get into the wrong hands, they would not be able to view any of the dreams data without the user’s password.

## 4- Deleting data

If at any point the user wants to delete data. By deleting the app this will clear the data from the local device.

If the user would like any backup emails that have been sent to also be deleted, please contact the email below. However, as the database is encrypted no one will be able to open it without knowing the password.
